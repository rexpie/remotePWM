# Control PWM output on Arduino board using your phone browser

## Install

    npm install


## Run

    npm start

After the script starts, a new QR code will appear in the folder.
Scan it with any QR code scanner on your phone, and if the scanner prompts for permission
to open a browser, please give your consent.

First put your phone flat on the table, then grab it up to a vertical 'selfie' posture (not the horizontal gaming posture). You should see the PWM output change by attaching an LED or motor on to pin 11.
